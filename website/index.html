        <h2>Execution</h2>
        <p>In order to complete this challenge I started with the backend. I created a Sam template "back.yml" that
        created a Lambda execution role specific for this challenge, a dynamo table, a lambda function, and an API
        with one resource. Then I created a nodejs12.x lambda function that uses the aws-sdk, DynamoDB DocClient.
        This function uses the update api which allows me to add an attribute to an item or increment an item
        attribute that has a number value. This function is tested with Jest. The test will pass only on the first
        iteraation unless the tester manually changes the expected return value as the function changes the value
        with every call.  </p>
        <p>For the website I needed to use Https and a cusotm domain name. So I created another template "front.yml"
        that adds a s3 bucket, bucket policy, tls certificate, cloudfront distribution, route 53 hosted
        zone(indirectly) and a record set group. Next I created a third template that calls the previous templates in
        order to create my stack.</p>
        <p>The only thing left to do was to add the static site to the website bucket. I initially planned to create
        a code pipeline from github but utimetly decided that since there really is no build and not test that using
        the aws cli would be as effective and quicker.</p>
